# WaterFlow-Anomaly-Detection

This project is designed to automatically detect consumption anomalies and leaks in urban water networks using machine learning and deep learning techniques. By leveraging advanced algorithms and the Minimum Night Flow (MNF) approach, the system identifies unusual consumption patterns and potential leaks, helping to optimize water usage and reduce waste in urban areas.

# Features

Automatic Detection of Consumption Anomalies: Detects anomalies in water consumption patterns, including:

- Meter Issues
- Water Outage
- Consumption Leak
- Return Water Issues
- Overconsumption
  
Leak Detection using MNF: Applies the Minimum Night Flow method to detect potential leaks in the water distribution network by analyzing low consumption periods at night.

Data Analysis: Prepares and processes historical consumption and flow data to train machine learning models.

Real-Time Detection: Identifies and flags anomalies in real-time to ensure proactive management and timely interventions.

# Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of water consumption data for 186 users, where:

- 92 normal users with no anomalies.
- 94 users with detected anomalies.
  
# Dataset Columns:

- user_number: Unique identifier for each user.
- datetime: Timestamp of the water consumption.
- Consommation: Amount of water consumed (in volume).
- anomalie: A binary indicator of whether an anomaly is present (1 for anomaly, 0 for normal).
- type: The type of anomaly (e.g., Meter Issues, Water Outage, Consumption Leak, Return Water Issues, Overconsumption).
