# WaterFlow-Anomaly-Detection

This project aims to detect consumption anomalies and leaks in urban water networks using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The solution leverages the Minimum Night Flow (MNF) approach to identify leaks by analyzing low-consumption periods and uses advanced algorithms to detect unusual consumption patterns that may indicate potential issues such as water wastage, measurement errors, or water theft.

# Features

- Automatic Detection of Consumption Anomalies: Uses machine learning models to identify unusual consumption behaviors.
- Leak Detection via MNF: Implements the Minimum Night Flow method to detect leaks in water distribution networks.
- Data Analysis: Preprocesses and analyzes historical water consumption and flow data.
